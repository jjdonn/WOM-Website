                            <div>Hello! This is Dr. Ben Donn. I'm hoping to become your
			                    personal dentist, so I'd like to share some information
			                    about myself. I grew up here in the Springs and graduated
			                    from Western State University, worked in IT for several
			                    years and then attended the University of Indiana School of
			                    Dentistry in Indianapolis. Subsequently, I completed a year
			                    of specialized training in dental implantology and I hold
			                    national certification in the American Academy of Implant
			                    Dentistry. In 2011 I returned to Colorado Springs, where I
			                    practiced complete care dentistry at North Powers Modern
			                    Dentistry. However, I decided being a personal "hometown
			                    doc" was a better fit for my personality. Consequently, I
			                    purchased the 40 year practice of Doctor Richard Mutchler in
			                    the Cheyenne Mountain /Broadmoor area, where I specialize in
			                    full-mouth restoration and full-time attention to your
			                    dental needs. My offices are immediately adjacent to Hwy 115
			                    and convenient to Interstate 25.

                        <div>First, let me say that I never actually take the time to sit down and write a review-good or bad. After my first visit today with Dr. Donn I knew I absolutely had to let people know what an amazing experience I had. I have seen several dentists, endodontists and oral surgeons due to a autoimmune disease that affects my teeth and gums. Dr. Donn was by far the most knowledgeable, compassionate, and calming professional I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He takes the time to explain everything that needs to be done and what he is doing as he does it. You don’t feel like your just part of some assembly line. He really does care about how your doing during the entire process. He truly listened to every single concern and anxiety I had, and by doing so my normal heart racing, arm chair gripping dental experience was turned into a much more enjoyable experience and was over in no time. I cannot say enough about Dr. Donn and his staff. Absolutely amazing!!!</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box-5">

                        <h3>DRAKE S.</h3>
                        <div>Dr. Donn is an awesome family dentist. He did a great job with my kids and me. My family is excited to have him as our dentist and look forward to many years of friendship and oral care. Thank you Dr. Donn and thank you to all of your staff for taking care of our family.

                        What an awesome group of people! Kristy couldn’t have been more professional and polite. Nicole was fantastic! I don’t know what she’s doing as a dental assistant, she really should be a dentist! She is experienced and it reflects in her work. Dr Donn is a dentist that genuinely cares about his patients. He constantly went above and beyond what you would expect from a dentist. I was dealing with some nerve pain and sensitivity from a prior tooth break. Dr Donn on a Saturday which was also his birthday was calling me personally to make sure my pain was being managed. Couldn’t be happier with my two new crowns and night guard. If I wasn’t separating from the military and moving back home there would be no doubt that Word of Mouth Dentistry would become my regular dentist. Thanks again!</div>
