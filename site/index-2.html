                            <div>Hello! This is Dr. Ben Donn. I'm hoping to become your
                    personal dentist, so I'd like to share some information
                    about myself. I grew up here in the Springs and graduated
                    from Western State University, worked in IT for several
                    years and then attended the University of Indiana School of
                    Dentistry in Indianapolis. Subsequently, I completed a year
                    of specialized training in dental implantology and I hold
                    national certification in the American Academy of Implant
                    Dentistry. In 2011 I returned to Colorado Springs, where I
                    practiced complete care dentistry at North Powers Modern
                    Dentistry. However, I decided being a personal "hometown
                    doc" was a better fit for my personality. Consequently, I
                    purchased the 40 year practice of Doctor Richard Mutchler in
                    the Cheyenne Mountain /Broadmoor area, where I specialize in
                    full-mouth restoration and full-time attention to your
                    dental needs. My offices are immediately adjacent to Hwy 115
                    and convenient to Interstate 25. </div>

                    </div>

                        <img src="images/icon-1.png" alt="" class="img-ind w1"/>
                        <div>
                            <div class="text-1"><a href="#" class="h-underline">10.14.2014</a></div>
                            <h3><a href="#" class="a-hov">Testimonial - Jack B.</a></h3>
                            <div>What an awesome group of people! Kristy couldn't have
                    been more professional and polite. Nicole was fantastic! I
                    don't know what she's doing as a dental assistant, she
                    really should be a dentist! She is experienced and it
                    reflects in her work. Dr Donn is a dentist that genuinely
                    cares about his patients. He constantly went above and
                    beyond what you would expect from a dentist. I was dealing
                    with some nerve pain and sensitivity from a prior tooth
                    break. Dr Donn on a Saturday which was also his birthday was
                    calling me personally to make sure my pain was being
                    managed. Couldn't be happier with my two new crowns and
                    night guard. If I wasn't separating from the military and
                    moving back home there would be no doubt that Word of Mouth
                    Dentistry would become my regular dentist. Thanks again!</div>
