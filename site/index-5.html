<p><a name="P42_4561"></a><h3>Privacy Authorization Forms</h3></p>

<p>Word of Mouth Family Dentistry is fully committed to the spirit and letter of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), including but not limited to the Privacy Rule that was issued pursuant to HIPAA. A major provision of the Privacy Rule is to safeguard sensitive, personal information about patients. This information is referred to as Protected Health Information (PHI), and includes individually identifiable health care and demographic data.</p>

<p>HIPAA allows Word of Mouth Family Dentistry to use and disclose certain member information for clearly defined treatment, payment and health care operations (TPO). However, patients have the right to restrict the release of information about them beyond these uses. The Individual Authorization Form provides the means for patients to identify who can see their PHI and what specific PHI can be seen for purposes other than TPO. If you need to have your PHI disclosed to someone outside of Word of Mouth Family Dentistry for purposes other than TPO, complete the form and submit it to us.  If you have questions, please contact our <a href="#P38_4162"><u>Privacy Officer</u></a>. </p>
