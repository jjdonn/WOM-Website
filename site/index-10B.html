                            <div>Hello! This is Dr. Ben Donn. I'm hoping to become your
			                    personal dentist, so I'd like to share some information
			                    about myself. I grew up here in the Springs and graduated
			                    from Western State University, worked in IT for several
			                    years and then attended the University of Indiana School of
			                    Dentistry in Indianapolis. Subsequently, I completed a year
			                    of specialized training in dental implantology and I hold
			                    national certification in the American Academy of Implant
			                    Dentistry. In 2011 I returned to Colorado Springs, where I
			                    practiced complete care dentistry at North Powers Modern
			                    Dentistry. However, I decided being a personal "hometown
			                    doc" was a better fit for my personality. Consequently, I
			                    purchased the 40 year practice of Doctor Richard Mutchler in
			                    the Cheyenne Mountain /Broadmoor area, where I specialize in
			                    full-mouth restoration and full-time attention to your
			                    dental needs.

                        <img src="images/cozzens.jpg" alt=""  align="left" class="img-ind w1"/>
                        <div>Dr. John Cozzens will be our new primary dentist servicing our Westside patients. He has relocated from Idaho and is excited to meet and work with all of our patients and family. His joining our team helps to integrate our values in taking care of our patients like family and adding a warm and fun atmosphere to the practice.
                            <br><br>Dr. Cozzens is originally from Utah and recently moved to the springs with his beautiful wife, daughter, and four dogs to pursue his final dental destination in beautiful Colorado! He enjoys spending time with his growing family, being the all-around handyman, fulfilling his wife's honey do list, being an American Idol singing super star in his alone time, hitting the beautiful Colorado slopes and is always open to learning something new! He loves a good Dad joke and loves nothing more than to bring smiles to those around him.
                            <br><br>Dr. Cozzens is extremely honest, patient and kind. He truly makes his patients the main priority and goes above and beyond to ensure they have a positive experience.
                            <br><br>Dr. John Cozzens is a Magna Cum Laude graduate from Weber State University in his hometown of Ogden, Utah. After graduating from Weber State, he received his Dental degree at Case Western Reserve University School of Dental Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio. Dr. Cozzens is an avid member of the American Dental Association in which he continues his education in general and cosmetic dentistry to provide an overall comprehensive and progressive approach to treating his patients. Continuing his education, Dr. Cozzens has additionally received his Invisalign certification to ensure an all-around beautiful smile for his patients.
                            <br><br>A few words from Dr. Cozzens:
                            <br><br>As a caring family dentist, I am committed to using my unique skill set in service to the community and my clinic. I am committed to accountability, unity as a team, owning challenges, helping others, consistency, kindness, honesty, treating each person in my influence with dignity and respect, working efficiently and effectively, time management, and keeping balanced in all areas of business, life, health, and family. When challenges arise, I believe in meeting them with professionalism and openness. I thrive on learning personally in dentistry, and as a team, and look forward to continually unlocking greater potential. I believe that successful dentistry is based on having a strong educational background and continued training, taking the time to provide quality care to each patient, and treating staff and patients the way I would want to be treated. I look forward to meeting and sharing these ideals.
                            <br><br>Dr. Cozzens looks forward to meeting you at your next visit!
