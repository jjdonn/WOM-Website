                <h2>Dental Implants</h2>
                <h3></h3>
                <p>A dental implant is an artificial tooth root that a dental practioner places into your jaw to hold a replacement tooth or bridge. Dental implants are an ideal option for people in good general oral health who have lost a tooth or teeth due to periodontal disease, an injury, or some other reason.</p>
                <p>While high-tech in nature, dental implants are actually more tooth-saving than traditional bridgework, since implants do not rely on neighboring teeth for support.</p>
                <p>Dental implants are so natural-looking and feeling, you may forget you ever lost a tooth. You know that your confidence about your teeth affects how you feel about yourself, both personally and professionally. Perhaps you hide your smile because of spaces from   missing teeth. Maybe your dentures don't feel secure. Perhaps you have difficulty chewing. If you are missing one or more teeth and would like   to smile, speak and eat again with comfort and confidence, there is good news! Dental implants are teeth that can look and feel just like your own! Under proper conditions, such as placement by a periodontist and   diligent patient maintenance, implants can last a lifetime. Long-term studies continue to show improving success rates for implants.</p>
                
                <h3>Advantages of Dental Implants over Dentures or a Bridge</h3>
              <p> Every way you look at it, dental implants are a better solution to the problem of missing teeth.<p>

<p><em><strong><u>Esthetic</u></strong></em> - Dental implants look and feel like your own teeth! Since dental implants integrate into the structure of your bone, they prevent the bone loss and gum recession that often accompany bridgework and dentures. No one will ever know that you have a replacement tooth.
<p><em><strong><u>Tooth-saving</u></strong></em> - Dental implants don't sacrifice the quality of your adjacent teeth like a bridge does because neighboring teeth are not altered to support the implant. More of your own teeth are left untouched, a significant long-term benefit to your oral health!<p>
<p><em><strong><u>Confidence</u></strong></em> - Dental implants will allow you to once again speak and eat with comfort and confidence! They are secure and offer freedom from the irksome clicks and wobbles of dentures. They'll allow you to say goodbye to worries about misplaced dentures and messy pastes and glues.<p>
<p><u><em><strong>Reliable</strong></em></u> - The success rate of dental implants is highly predictable. They are considered an excellent option for tooth replacement.</p>
              <h3>Are you a good candidate for Dental Implants</h3>
              <p> The ideal candidate for a dental implant is in good general and oral health. Adequate bone in your jaw is needed to support the implant, and the best candidates have healthy gum tissues that are free of periodontal disease.<p>

<p>Dental implants are intimately connected with the gum tissues and underlying bone in the mouth. Since your dental practioner is a dental expert who specializes in precisely these areas. Your dentist and you will attempt to make your dreams come true and create an ideal replacement of your missing teeth.</p>
              <h3>What is treatment like</h3>
              <p>This procedure is a team effort between you and your dentist and possiblyyour periodontist. Your dentist will consult with you to determine where and how your implant should be placed. Depending on your specific condition and the type of implant chosen, your dental practioner will create a treatment plan tailored to meet your needs.</p>
                <p>Replacing a Single Tooth-If you are missing a single tooth, one implant and a crown can replace it. A dental implant replaces both the lost natural tooth and its root.<p>
Replacing Several Teeth-If you are missing several teeth, implant-supported bridges can replace them. Dental implants will replace both your lost natural teeth and some of the roots.
<p>Replacing All of Your Teeth If you are missing all of your teeth, an implant-supported full bridge or full denture can replace them. Dental implants will replace both your lost natural teeth and some of the roots.<p>
<p>Sinus Augmentation-A key to implant success is the quantity and quality of the bone where the implant is to be placed. The upper back jaw has traditionally been one of the most difficult areas to successfully place dental implants due to insufficient bone quantity and quality and the close proximity to the sinus. Sinus augmentation can help correct this problem by raising the sinus floor and developing bone for the placement of dental implants.<p>
<p>Ridge Modification-Deformities in the upper or lower jaw can leave you with inadequate bone in which to place dental implants. To correct the problem, the gum is lifted away from the ridge to expose the bony defect. The defect is then filled with bone or bone substitute to build up the ridge. Ridge modification has been shown to greatly improve appearance and increase your chances for successful implants that can last for years to come.<p>

<h3>What Can I expect After Treatment</h3>
<p>As you know, your own teeth require conscientious at-home oral care and regular dental visits. Dental implants are like your own teeth and will require the same care. In order to keep your implant clean and plaque-free, brushing and flossing still apply!

After treatment, your dental practioner will work closely with you to develop the best care plan for you. Periodic follow-up visits will be scheduled to monitor your implant, teeth and gums to make sure they are healthy.<p>
