                            <div>Whether you do it when you’re awake or asleep, teeth grinding can lead to numerous dental problems later on. Known in the dental and medical community as bruxism, it’s an all-too-common condition that occurs in some 30-50 million Americans. Unfortunately, most people go throughout their daily lives completely oblivious to the negative health effects of teeth grinding. It’s not until the condition has created unwanted side effects that most people realize the true impact of grinding their teeth.

                               <h2 dir="ltr">Causes of Teeth Grinding</h2>

Before we go into some of the problems associated with teeth grinding, let’s first discuss the causes of this condition. One of the most common causes of teeth grinding is stress (mental, not physical). It’s a common assumption that stress is only psychological and doesn’t manifest itself through physical symptoms; however, this simply isn’t true.
<p>

According to StatisticsBrain.com, 77% of people living in the U.S. report regular physical symptoms brought on by stress, including teeth grinding. When you’re stressed, the muscles in your body instinctively tighten. In turn, this forces the jaw shut, causing the individual to grind his or her teeth.
<p>
Other causes of teeth grinding include the temporormandibular joint (or TMJ, the jaw joint), insomnia, gum disease, and malocclusion (misalignment). Children are more likely to grind their teeth, but this condition may appear in people of all ages.
<p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Problems Caused by Teeth Grinding</h2>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Headaches</span></strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>


You might be surprised to learn that grinding your teeth for long periods of time can trigger headaches. Constantly forcing pressure against your upper and lower jawbone stresses the nervous system, which may trigger a headache or migraine. It’s not uncommon for people to wake up with a headache and/or earache after grinding their teeth at night.
<p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Damages Teeth</span></strong></h3>
<p>

Of course, bruxism can also lead to tooth damage. The outer layer of enamel protecting our teeth is incredibly strong, but this doesn’t necessarily mean it will hold up under the stress of grinding. Grinding your teeth night after night may result in wearing of the enamel or even create cracks and fractures.
<p>
If you have any cavities, bridges or other dental work, grinding your teeth could leave them vulnerable to damage.
<p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Underbite or Overbite</span></strong></h3>
<p>
Teeth grinding increases the risk of developing an underbite or overbite. Whether you’re young, old or anywhere in between, your natural jaw position may shift due to bruxism. It’s not something that happens overnight, but several years of teeth grinding may lead to the development of either an underbite or overbite.

                    <div class="clearfix">

                        <div>
               Gum
 recession, or gingival recession, is a condition in which the gum 
surrounding the teeth begins to gradually pull back towards the jaw. As 
the gum tissue continues to recede, the sensitive portion of the tooth’s
 roots are left exposed and vulnerable to sensitivity, decay and 
bacteria. This is why it’s important for individuals to take a proactive
 approach towards preventing gum recession. In this post, we’re going to
 take a look at some of the most common causes of gum recession.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Cause #1) Aggressive Brushing</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="http://www.cda.org/Portals/0/pdfs/fact_sheets/receding_gums_english.pdf">California Dental Association (CDA) states</a>,
 “gums that recede to expose the root surfaces of teeth is a common 
condition in adults over the age of 40. Many consider it to be just a 
sign of aging, and in some cases it is essentially that—often the result
 of wear and tear or years of aggressive tooth brushing.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">We’ve been taught at an early age that brushing is 
essential to preventing tooth decay, but a topic that’s oftentimes 
overlooked is aggressive brushing. When you press against your teeth and
 gums with too much force, it may cause the gums to recede. Be conscious
 of your brushing technique and if your gums feel sore or tender 
afterward, use less force the next time you brush.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Cause #2) Periodontal Disease</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Another common cause of gum recession is periodontal 
disease (gum disease). It’s estimated that three out four adults have at
 least some form of periodontal disease. Drinking lots of sugar-rich, 
heavily acidic beverages may contribute to this disease, as does smoking
 cigarettes. If your lifestyle includes either of these bad habits, 
consider making some changes to improve the health of your gums (as well
 as your overall health).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Cause #3) Heredity</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, some people are naturally predisposed to gum
 recession due to genetics. If your parents and grandparents experience 
this condition, there’s a good chance you will too. However, you can 
help protect your teeth and gums from the effects of gum recession by 
brushing lightly and flossing on a regular basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Cause #4) Trauma</h2>
<p dir="ltr">A fourth possible cause of gum recession is direct physical
 trauma. For instance, hockey players are placed at a high risk for gum 
recession, along with other dental problems, due to the constant blows 
they receive to their mouth. Although a mouthpiece helps to absorb some 
of the blow, their teeth and gums are still vulnerable to the physical 
trauma of behind hit game after game.</p>
